# MySQL-Portfolio-Projects
## This repository contains all the MySQL projects that I have compoleted and more projects will be added in due course.
### Below is a list of the projects and a brief description about them ;
### 1. Data Cleaning
#### The purpose of this project was to clean the raw dataset to  make it more accuarte for the nesxt step which was the exploratory date analysis. I started by creating a copy of the original data and then proceeded to remove duplicates from the data. The next step was to ensure the data was standrdized and free from all errors. In the third step, all null and blank values were either populated or deleted. The final step was to delete all redundant columns from the dataset. 
### 2. Portfolio Project.Auto Sales Data
#### After cleaning and standardizing the raw dataset in excel, I uploaded the dataset into MySQL server for further analysis. The analysis explored several aspects of a company in the automobile industry including finding out the best perfoming product, the biggest customers and their location, the best sales year, the total number of product in the productline and the sizes of the deals that have been made over the years.
